# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates the classification of the famous Iris dataset using three machine learning models: 

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

The dataset is preprocessed with standard scaling and label encoding. The models are trained on a training set and evaluated on a test set. Accuracy and confusion matrices are visualized for comparison.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: StandardScaler and LabelEncoder
- Model training: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- Visualization: Accuracy bar chart and heatmap of confusion matrices

## Dataset

The [Iris dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris/data) contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) with 4 features each:  

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install the required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`)  
3. Run the Python script `iris_classification_models.py`
